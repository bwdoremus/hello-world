By day I work on an economic research team for an institutional commercial real estate investor. By night I am a student at Columbia University studying Quantitative Methods. Much of the rest of the time I am either playing with my dogs Sherlock and Shakespeare, reading mystery books, classic literature and The Economist, or watching my favorite soccer team, Manchester United.
